The Course
========================================================

This course introduces some of the fundamental concepts and tools of RNA-seq analysis in R/Bioconductor. This course is a shortened version of our full course 


Each section is presented as both HTMl and Rpres markdown ( to allow for intergration of the presentation in the RStudio enviroment itself).  Exercises and answer sheets are included after all subsections to practice techniques and provide future reference examples. 

 
All material is available to download under GPL v3 license. For information on other courses run by our team see our [website](http://bioinformatics.lms.mrc.ac.uk/LMStraining.html).
